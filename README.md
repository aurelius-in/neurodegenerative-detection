### Introduction

Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, progressively impair cognitive and motor functions. Early detection is crucial for effective intervention and management. This project aims to develop a multimodal system that leverages artificial intelligence to analyze speech patterns, facial expressions, and movement behaviors, facilitating the early identification of these conditions.

### Features

- **Speech Analysis:** Utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to detect anomalies in speech patterns indicative of cognitive decline.
- **Facial Expression Recognition:** Employs Computer Vision to assess facial expressiveness and identify potential neurological impairments.
- **Movement Tracking:** Analyzes motor functions through gesture and gait analysis to detect abnormalities.
- **Data Integration:** Combines data from various sources to provide a comprehensive assessment.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed for accessibility by healthcare professionals and patients.

### System Architecture

1. **Data Collection:**
   - **Speech Data:** Capture audio recordings of patients during structured interviews or spontaneous conversations to analyze speech patterns.
   - **Facial Expression Data:** Utilize video recordings to monitor facial expressions and detect anomalies indicative of neurological impairments.
   - **Movement Data:** Record videos to assess motor functions through gesture and gait analysis, identifying abnormalities in movement patterns.

2. **Data Processing:**
   - **Preprocessing:** Clean and normalize audio and video data to ensure consistency and reliability.
   - **Feature Extraction:**
     - **Speech Features:** Extract features such as pitch, tone, speech rate, and articulation from audio data.
     - **Facial Features:** Analyze facial landmarks and expressions using computer vision techniques.
     - **Movement Features:** Assess gait patterns, tremors, and other motor functions from video data.

3. **Data Integration:**
   - Combine extracted features from speech, facial expressions, and movement data to create a comprehensive profile for each patient.

4. **Machine Learning Models:**
   - **Training:** Use labeled datasets to train models capable of identifying patterns associated with early stages of neurodegenerative diseases.
   - **Classification:** Implement classifiers to differentiate between healthy individuals and those at risk.

5. **User Interface:**
   - Develop an intuitive interface for healthcare professionals to input data and view diagnostic results.
   - Ensure the interface provides clear visualizations of analyzed data and model predictions.

6. **Deployment:**
   - Host the system on a secure, scalable cloud platform to facilitate remote access and real-time analysis.
   - Implement data encryption and compliance with healthcare regulations to ensure patient confidentiality and data security.

### Installation

Detailed installation instructions will be provided upon the development of each system component.

### Usage

Guidelines on how to operate the system, input data, and interpret results will be included in the user manual.

### Datasets

The system will utilize publicly available datasets for training and validation, including:

- **PROMPT Dataset:** Contains video data collected from patients with dementia during interviews, useful for analyzing facial expressions and speech patterns.

- **Toronto NeuroFace Dataset:** A publicly available annotated dataset of video recordings from patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and stroke, valuable for assessing facial expressions related to neurological conditions.
